h2. New features
* Multicast/broacast frame forwarding with controlled flooding.
* On-Demand HWMP (based on hopcount, not airtime link metric)

h2. Known issues
* Multiple links per peer are not supported.  To avoid deadlocks that would result from this limitation, a 'CLOSE' mesh peer link management frame will close all links 'ESTABLISHED' with the sender even if _link IDs_ do not match.
