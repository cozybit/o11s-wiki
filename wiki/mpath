The columns, from left to right, are:

h2. Destination MAC Address

The destination for this Mesh Path. Direct paths have the same MAC address for the destination and next-hop.

h2. Next-hop MAC address

The next hop on the way to the destination.  Direct paths have the same MAC address for the destination and next-hop.

h2. Device Name

Network device (ex: "mesh").

h2. DSN

The Destination Sequence Number for this path.  The DSN is used to determine the 'freshnesss' of a node's path information.  For example, suppose a node receives a path response for a destination that is already in its path table.  If the path response has a higher DSN, it will replace the existing path because it will be considered fresher.

h2. Air Time Link Metric

A metric (or "cost") of taking the path.  Lower metrics are preferred and, given the choice of multiple paths, the stack will chose the least expensive (ie: the one with the lowest Air Time Link Metric).

h2. Frame Queue Length

Number of queued frames for this Mesh Path.

h2. Expiration Time

Time when this Mesh Path will expire, in jiffies.

h2. Discovery Timeout

Time remaining for path discovery (if this path is being discovered).

h2. Discovery Retries

Number of times discovery has been retried (if this path is being discovered).

h2. Flags

This is a bitmask consisting of the following state flags for this path:
<pre><code>
        MESH_PATH_ACTIVE =      BIT(0),
        MESH_PATH_RESOLVING =   BIT(1), 
        MESH_PATH_DSN_VALID =   BIT(2), 
        MESH_PATH_FIXED =       BIT(3),
        MESH_PATH_RESOLVED =    BIT(4),
</code></pre>
