h2. distro11s-0.03

distro11s-0.03 is just tested on the zotacs.

h2. CHANGES

* Only somewhat related to distro11s, wireshark SVN now has support for lots of mesh features.

* authsae (er, meshd-nl80211) now has a unified configuration file and honors the channel that you specify.

* meshkit now launches an AP when configured to do so.  So if you don't have a control network, you can at least connect to each distro11s node and login.

* kernel supports mesh gateways advertised in root announcement (RANN) frames.

* iw supports setting the RANN announcement interval and setting the gateway bit in the RANN announcements.

h2. KNOWN ISSUES

* Only one mesh gateway per mesh network is currently supported.
