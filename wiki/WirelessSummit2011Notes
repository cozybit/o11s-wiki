h2. device-controlled P2P offloads

Goal is to have in firmware listen for off-channel P2P management frames and not doing that in wpa_supplicant.

Jouni: offloading the entire functionality is hard, but at least time sensitive portions should be doable: extended listen timing, sending probe response, ...

Discussion on roaming offloading.

Partial scanning, aborting a scan.

h2. non-mac80211 drivers

Jouni: ath6k, hostapd works with packet sockets, no monitor interface anymore.

libnl boated

h2. DFS

neratec: DFS implementations for proprietary drivers.  

h2. Test sharing

Autotest aginst cisco APs (using SNMP for configuring) or against openwrt APs.

autotest for p2p? felix: ok
hwsim? only used for development: Jouni, Luis and Johannes

h2. wpa_supplicant plugin

johannes: goal is to allow multiple applications to send requests to wpa_supplicant without confusing its internal state machines.
